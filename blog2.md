# Welcome to the **Snowing Planet**

{% welcome 'Snowing' 'snowflake' %}
<p>
The Snowing planet was a planet I was not willing to go to, from our records we were sure that it was not a gaseous planet as the temperature will make the floor essentially an Ice floor. We learnt on landing there that the temperature there was -273k which means that no life form can leave there. We imidiately marked that planet as a red zone. The trip there did not last 10 minutes, we immediately set out to go back to Earth!
